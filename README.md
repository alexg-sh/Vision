## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
*   A running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database instance.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Project_Vision
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Update `.env.local` with your specific configuration:
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public`)
        *   `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The base URL of your application during development (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
        *   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for NextAuth. Generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32` or visit `https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32`.
        *   Add any other required variables for OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.) if you plan to use them.

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    *   This will synchronize your database schema with the Prisma schema definition.
    ```bash
    pnpm prisma migrate dev
    ```
    *   *(Optional)* If you need to generate the Prisma client explicitly:
        ```bash
        pnpm prisma generate
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

6.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified) in your web browser.
