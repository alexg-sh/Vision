## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or compatible based on `DATABASE_URL`)
*   **ORM:** [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
*   **Authentication:** [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **UI Components:** [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
*   **State Management:** React Context API, `useState`
*   **Package Manager:** [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
*   A running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database instance.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Project_Vision
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Update `.env.local` with your specific configuration:
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public`)
        *   `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The base URL of your application during development (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
        *   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for NextAuth. Generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32` or visit `https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32`.
        *   Add any other required variables for OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.) if you plan to use them.

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    *   This will synchronize your database schema with the Prisma schema definition.
    ```bash
    pnpm prisma migrate dev
    ```
    *   *(Optional)* If you need to generate the Prisma client explicitly:
        ```bash
        pnpm prisma generate
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

6.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified) in your web browser.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root with the following keys:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
# OAuth providers (if used):
GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
GOOGLE_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm dev              # Run development server
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm start            # Start production server
pnpm prisma migrate dev  # Apply database migrations
pnpm prisma generate   # Regenerate Prisma client
pnpm lint             # Run linter (Next.js)
pnpm test             # Run unit tests (Jest)
pnpm test:watch       # Run Jest in watch mode
pnpm test:e2e          # Run Playwright E2E tests
```

## Testing

- Unit tests: `pnpm test`
- Watch mode: `pnpm test:watch`
- End-to-end tests: `pnpm test:e2e`

Ensure the development server is running (`pnpm dev`) before running E2E tests.

## Deployment

This app is production-ready for deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your repo to GitHub.
2. Import the project in Vercel.
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard.
4. Enable automatic `pnpm prisma migrate deploy` in Post-build hooks.

You can also deploy via Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pnpm install && pnpm build
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```
